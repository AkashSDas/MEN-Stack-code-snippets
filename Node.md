#### As per Node:
	1. Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

	2. Node.js uses an event driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

	3. Node.js's package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libaries in the world
	
**`Node is how we run JavaScript on the server side.`**

- Reasons of People liking it:
	- Great Libraries
	- JavaScript
	- Npm
	- High-Performance
	- Open Source
	- Great for API's
	- Great Community
	- Asynchronous
	- Great for realtime apps
	- Great for command line utilities
	
#### Using Node
- Node Console:
	- It has its own version of console, it is all based on command line.
	- You can write JavaScript `SOME` command there.
	- You can't do something like alert("hello").
	- Because alert comes with the browser, we are not writing in browser, our command is running in some server side where there is no browser.
	- Similar DOM's, document, events then don't exist here, they are in the browser only.
	- Now we are working in the server side, BackEnd
	
	- Start by writing on command line - node
	- Running a javascript file with node - node filename.js

## Introduction to npm
`npm is the package manager for JavaScript.`

- A large amount of packages are centralised in npm
- npm has command line tool to install packages, in command we have to write
```bash
npm install packagename
```

### Installing and Using Packages
	1. Use 'npm intall' to install a package
	2. Use 'require()' to include a pacakage
	3. The package we install will be downloaded in a directory name 'node_module'
	4. Using require: var Something = require("Package Name");
